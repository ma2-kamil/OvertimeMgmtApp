# OvertimeMgmtApp

Android Prototype Applicaiton where users can find and book overtime shifts fast. 

Managers can sign up and post shifts which are pushed to an online database. (This can be configured to your own online database if you wish).

Managers give their 'unique code' to their employees to sign up with and then can instantly find shifts and list their own availabilities at a touch of a button

Users are able to find shifts in real time and book whichever shift suits them best.

The "OT" folder contains the php files used for inserting, deleting, changing data. I used my own local server for most of the development 
but have migrated to an online webserver.
