# OvertimeMgmtApp

Android Prototype Applicaiton where users can register and find and book overtime shifts fast. 
It lets managers sign up and post shifts which are pushed to a local database. (This can be configured to your own online database if you wish).
Users are able to see shifts in real time and book whichever shift suits them best.

Note:
To configure on own server you must download the project and configure on your server. 
The "OT" folder with php files must be copied to your server. I used my own local server using WAMP and phpmyadmin. 
You must also change the urls to (where your php files are located) in the java code, most of these are in the backgroundworker class. 
Then just build and run the app on your device or Android Studio.
